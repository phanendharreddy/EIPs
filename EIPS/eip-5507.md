## Abstract

This EIP adds refund functionality for initial NFT offerings to [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) and [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md). Funds are held in escrow until a predetermined time before they are claimable. Until that predetermined time passes, users can receive a refund for NFTs they have purchased.

## Motivation

The NFT space lacks accountability. For the health of the NFT ecosystem as a whole, better mechanisms to prevent rugpulls from happening are needed. Offering refunds provides greater protection for buyers and increases legitimacy for creators.

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

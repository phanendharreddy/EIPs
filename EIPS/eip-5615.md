## Abstract

This EIP introduces a simple mechanism to fetch token supply data from [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md) tokens that is backward compatible with most existing solutions. It adds a `totalSupply` function, which fetches the total supply of a given token `ID`, and an `exists` function, which checks for the existence of a given token `ID`.

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

```solidity
interface ERC1155Supply /* is ERC1155 */ {
  // @notice      This function MUST returns the total supply (number of tokens in circulation) with a given ID if it exists, otherwise it MUST revert
  // @param   id  The ID of which fetch the total supply
  // @return      The total supply of the given token ID
  function totalSupply(uint256 id) external view returns (uint256);

  // @notice      This function MUST return true if the given token ID exists, otherwise it MUST return false
  // @param   id  The ID of which to check the existence
  // @return      Whether the given token ID exists or not
  function exists(uint256 id) external view returns (bool);
}
```

## Rationale

This EIP does not extend [EIP-165](./eip-165.md) as this interface was deemed simple enough that the extra complexity was unnecessary. It would also break backward compatibility with potential existing implementations.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP is backward compatible with the OpenZeppelin `ERC1155Supply`.

## Security Considerations

Needs discussion.

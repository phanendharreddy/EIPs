## Abstract
This standard is an extension of [EIP-1155](./eip-1155.md). It proposes introducing the concept of independent, multiple, and leasable rights of use to enable NFT to be leased out for different cycles while ownership remains with the owner.

## Motivation
The traditional [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) and EIP-1155 focus more on ownership. However, NFTs as digital assets are more prominent in use than ownership. Taking artistic NFTs as an example, NFT artists may wish to rent out the use rights of their works to media companies for an allotted time, or NFT musicians may wish to make their music available to listeners as per playing duration. 
Therefore, to better serve NFT developers to meet such needs and develop more sophisticated NFT products, we propose directly introducing rentable usage rights to complement the ERC standard.


## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

    /**

    function propertyRightOf(uint256 id) external view returns (address);

    /**
    * @notice Return the total supply amount of the current token
    **/
    function totalSupply(uint256 id) external view returns (uint256);
}


```
## Rationale
There are two main benefits to creating this proposal. One is to make it possible to create NFTs with detachable usage rights, of which the transfer of usage rights is separated from the transfer of ownership. The NFT owner can execute the safeRent function to lease out the usage rights to other users and the takeBack function to retrieve the usage rights after the lease expiration.

## Backwards Compatibility
As mentioned at the beginning, this is an extension of EIP-1155. Therefore, it is fully backward compatible with EIP-1155.

## Security Considerations
Needs discussion.
